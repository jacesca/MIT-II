	It's been  a  great journey so far!!!
22:03:32 From Gunjan Vaishnav To All Panelists:
	It has been excellent journey thus far. Thank you all professors and mentors. Found new ways of looking at data, problems, thinking and applying.
22:03:32 From [GL Mentor] Shubham Sharma To Everyone:
	@Victor I am in PST today üôÇ
22:13:53 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	Can you please go over the PCA part agin
22:14:13 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	i had a question last week about cos 180 degrees. how do you get a sim of -1?
22:14:19 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	last time.
22:14:19 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	Is there ever an instance where the data remains categorical in nature and Kmodes applies?
22:14:21 From Yolanda Dolores To Everyone:
	k-means since we're reviewing
22:14:24 From B. M. To All Panelists:
	why can‚Äôt we jump directly to k means but rather use pca?
22:14:30 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	Is PCA the same as SVD
22:14:40 From Marco Ocana To Everyone:
	Couldn‚Äôt clustering be done in multiple dimensions? Is PCA essential?
22:14:43 From Goutam Ghosh To Everyone:
	d dimensional is lower dimensional space right?
22:14:51 From aseem gupta To Everyone:
	difference between SVD and SVT and where are they used?
22:15:04 From Angel Rafael Ortega Ramirez To Everyone:
	Is there any package to perform recommendation systems with pyspark?
22:15:05 From Changsong Liu To Everyone:
	do we worry about overfitting in this kind of approach (non-parametric nearest neighbor method)
22:15:24 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	Are there other similarity functions that we could use other than cosine?
22:16:08 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	jacquard, centered cosine similarity
22:17:28 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	can we interpret the meaning of each PCA? in other words, what will the PCA of the similarity matrix tell me? and why we still need k-means after? thanks
22:21:16 From aseem gupta To Everyone:
	How do you calculate sigma?
22:22:45 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	could you show the next page again
22:22:48 From aseem gupta To Everyone:
	Thank you,
22:23:05 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	thank you
22:23:18 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	Thank you! this was great!
22:30:36 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	R components? Are components the entries
22:30:38 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	?
22:31:02 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	shuld the indices of mhat be ik and kj?
22:32:05 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	is that for a given r?
22:34:12 From Gunjan Vaishnav To Everyone:
	I have heard about Affinities and Lead Scoring.. where do they fit in recommendation systems overall, conceptually
22:34:44 From Venkatesh Prasad To Everyone:
	If any of values in uij and vkj are not observed then they are excluded, correct?
22:35:18 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Upper bound of outer Summation is ‚Äúmin‚Äù, what is the minimum?
22:35:22 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	is the optimization problem for a given r?
22:37:01 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	And I j also goes upto m x n?
22:37:05 From Venkatesh Prasad To Everyone:
	When you are summing over (I,j) observed, what are you excluding?
22:37:56 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Where to stop the outer summation ?
22:37:57 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	are we solving this optimization problem with NN?
22:38:20 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Ok got it. No worries
22:38:50 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Thank you!
22:42:16 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	would you please use the simple example(with numbers) to demonstrate the process?
22:45:55 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	That was helpful , thanks
22:46:19 From Mohammed Al Farsi To Everyone:
	what is the target hear?
22:47:40 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	So do we combine the replacing ? with 0 and also this optimization where we don't replace to find the final answer or are they always used in separate situations
22:47:42 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	Thank you!

	That means the dotted trend in GDP is the counterfactual ?
22:51:53 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	Thanks
22:51:54 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Prediction of GDP because of terrorism
22:52:00 From Satya Bhan To All Panelists:
	Why does the prediction and reality follow so closely?
22:52:18 From Jacqueline Escalante de Cortez To Everyone:
	Identify how GDP will behaves without terrorism?
22:52:33 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	so when did terrorism happen only when they are deviating?
22:52:33 From Rahul Rana To Everyone:
	Is this  time series extrapolation
22:53:22 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	How did you account for any other issues that may have affected the economy like weather?
22:53:44 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	So the line for terrorism is at which year was my question
22:53:54 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	got it!     Thanks
22:54:06 From Rahul Rana To Everyone:
	How are we drawing causality from this?
22:54:25 From Jacqueline Escalante de Cortez To Everyone:
	It is the same case, right?
	We are looking at what will be the tendency without the external factor
22:54:55 From Ron Carino To Everyone:

	+1, thanks!
22:56:30 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	that's your paper :)
22:57:13 From Nicol√°s S To Everyone:
	So donor in the example of the Basque Country would be another close region's GDP?
22:57:54 From Maksim Virskii To All Panelists:
	Can you please explain how you have used the methods we‚Äôve used to make an approximation??
22:58:38 From Maksim Virskii To All Panelists:
	That was SVD?
22:58:43 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	the donors must also be affected by the intervention or not required?
22:58:48 From Nicol√°s S To Everyone:
	Got it, thanks
22:59:39 From Maksim Virskii To Everyone:
	How do we use recommendation system to make a forecast of GDP of basks without terrorism>
22:59:40 From Maksim Virskii To Everyone:
	?
23:00:07 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	When the word synthetic is used, is it always referring to causal inference/counterfactual?
23:00:21 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	thx
23:01:32 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	@prof - i'm an epidemiologist so causal inference is a big thing. just trying to learn how to talk to talk.
23:19:06 From Alexander Prinz To Everyone:
	amazing explanation! üòÉ
23:19:08 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Nicely explained
23:19:28 From Yolanda Dolores To Everyone:
	I am trying to understand some examples of what would be noise, is it false positives?
23:19:33 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	Zij is the noise?
23:19:34 From Yolanda Dolores To Everyone:
	neg?
23:19:34 From Christina Bell To Everyone:
	What measure would you use to determine that your content is good enough and don't need to continue with rating based approach
23:19:41 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	will the parameters alpha and beta remain constant after training or calibration ?
23:20:21 From Sashi Rekha Manickam Kasiviswanathan To Everyone:
	How to validate your Estimates are good enough?
23:20:29 From Yolanda Dolores To Everyone:
	ok
23:21:04 From Satya Bhan To Everyone:
	Noise will always exist since the mean is 0 and it cannot therefore be predicted or learnt
23:21:07 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	so we are running the ratings on the non-observed estimates ?
23:22:09 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Inspired by Proff getting a carrot to eat :-)
23:22:21 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	Thanks
23:27:52 From Alexander Prinz To Everyone:
	5 7 ?
23:27:55 From Jacqueline Escalante de Cortez To Everyone:
	5 7 ?
23:27:55 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	5 and 7
23:27:55 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	57?
23:27:55 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	last matrix
23:27:55 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	5 7 ?
23:27:57 From Sashi Rekha Manickam Kasiviswanathan To Everyone:
	5/7/?
23:28:02 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	5 7 ?
23:29:35 From Vahid Monfared To Everyone:
	There is a simple code in Python that can find some numbers randomly as a weights for given numbers of matrix and predict a patern for known values, and after finding these weights simply applied to find the unknows by multiplication. Is it correct?
23:29:59 From Ihor Aleksykov To Everyone:
	What should we do in case not possible to build quadratic matrix?
23:30:02 From Steve Trenfield To Everyone:
	What would you do if you didn‚Äôt have a perfect square number of values?
23:30:52 From Ihor Aleksykov To Everyone:
	Could we add extra items to predict ?
23:31:13 From Nicol√°s S To Everyone:
	How can you trust the forecast if the time series is not stationary?
23:31:44 From Christina Bell To Everyone:
	How interpretable do stakeholders find these forecasts to be, in your experience?
23:32:50 From Michelle Mertens To Everyone:
	Should you choose your matrix size based on the seasonality?
23:33:19 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	How does this method generally compares wrt to ARIMA models? In terms of forecasting performance?
23:35:17 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	can you elaborate on how to read backa a time series. Thanks.
23:35:56 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	thank you!
23:36:04 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Can we use the same method for content based ?
23:36:11 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	I am with you Pam, I am in health care and since data scientists make some algorithmic decisions based on personal preferences, two data scientists can use the same data and models and have different predictions.  Then we are left with explaining these models to lay people.
23:37:04 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	Is the matrix version the same as multivariate time series or panel data approach ?
23:37:50 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	Great!! will look into that.  Thank you Prof.
23:38:18 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	Thanks
23:38:18 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	What is the advantage of the matrix version vs implementing the solution with one series at a time, one by one??
23:38:20 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	Adapting these methods to health care is a daunting task but it's happening already. I'm here so i can learn how to understand what's going on and the benefits and potential pitfalls.
23:43:19 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	what is l?
23:46:26 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	This is amazing!
23:46:51 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	OMG you are a total rock star!!!
23:48:56 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	"It's that simple" :D
23:49:08 From Jonathan Liggett To Everyone:
	Funny
23:49:11 From Barbara Knowles To Everyone:
	I think you and I go to different cocktail parties
23:49:18 From Victoria Le To Everyone:
	Let‚Äôs have a cocktail party and talk algorithms.
23:49:20 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	In the previous class I asked you about the application of this models towards for example a) "Parenting" capacity building, and b) best livelihoods development for vulnerable populations in developing countries. Could you elaborate if/how we could do this?
23:49:23 From Edwin Obando Hernandez To Everyone:
	Many thanks!!!

23:50:17 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	Thank you professor
23:50:19 From Victoria Le To Everyone:
	Maybe a carrot party.
23:50:31 From Burt Sloane To Everyone:
	Thanks!
23:50:32 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	one suggestion: in the future, don't eat carrots when you teach. you could choke and we need you to stick around.
23:50:34 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	It is better explained simple. Eat your own dog food and split it and eat so many times that it converges. Simple to explain. Jokes apart experience of these will add the meat on the frame - Thank you proff.
23:50:35 From Jean-Christophe Pignon To Everyone:
	Could you also elaborate about applications in of recommendation system in precision medicine
23:50:38 From Bill Hutchison To Everyone:
	You taught very well - thank you so much. Not easy to teach or to understand. I have not grasped it all, but I am well on the way which is nothing short of a miracle.
23:50:39 From MIKE I.C. ABEJO To Everyone:
	you're amazing professor! Thanks a lot!
23:50:39 From Wendye Mingo To Everyone:

	I will invite you to my cocktail party.....
23:50:58 From Andrea Robles To Everyone:
	Profesor many thanks.  First session you offer a course. How can I get accesos?
23:51:05 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	It seems that we have some ways to analysis the complex system problem.
23:51:06 From Maksim Virskii To Everyone:
	In forecasting stock price (shown on a slide with comparison vs DeepAR & Prophet) what else is used for estimation along with the stock price of the past periods?
23:51:18 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	We work in developing countries, with donors, we have relevant data from different programs we have implemented in terms of ages, program interventions (training, cash transfers, etc.), and inclusion of gender. Then, how could apply the recommendation process/formula to identify the best mix of interventions to alleviate poverty?
23:52:04 From Barbara Knowles To Everyone:
	That is a very cool question
23:52:10 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	@Bill Hutchinson completely agree with you.
23:53:08 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	Alzheimer's i think
23:53:25 From Laura Truncellito To Everyone:
	Can you elaborate on how we might utilize individualized recommendation system if we only have access to limited data? Thank you prof.!
23:53:57 From Jean-Christophe Pignon To Everyone:
	Thank you!
23:54:05 From Laxmi Narayana Byagari To Everyone:
	Thank You
23:54:22 From Subhanku Chatterjee To Everyone:
	Thanks a lot!!
23:54:28 From Changsong Liu To Everyone:
	for the matrix-completion based time-series method, is the matrix at time t very different from t-1, or matrix at time t just add more information (observations) to matrix at time t-1, which of the two scenarios is more suitable for this method?
23:54:33 From Changsong Liu To Everyone:
	and this method does captures the "time-series" part (i.e., relations between t and t-1), right?
23:55:08 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:

23:56:36 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	it sounds like the data is placed in matrix shape and being processed for future predictions, you mentioned recommendation systems is universal prediction, can we assume we can do the same for motion pictures? or any time varying frames?
23:56:39 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	thanks!
23:56:52 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	Thank you !!!
23:57:49 From Tom Chacko To Everyone:
	What Andrea asked, I think, is that you mentioned that you would give free pass to attend a class/course related to recommendation systems.
23:57:59 From Laura Truncellito To Everyone:
	Thank you Prof!
23:59:23 From Andrea Robles To Everyone:
	Thanks Tom!
23:59:26 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:

	Very well explained thanks!
00:05:39 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	Shubham, the Professor said that after this three classes we should be able to explain in a cocktail party how does recommendation algorithms and the whole process work. Could I please kindly ask you to do so for us here? In one minute or so, explain it to us as if we were in a cocktail party, with napkin in front of us to write anything we need.
00:07:37 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	The idea is to find the Next item in the series.. to predict. right?
00:08:04 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam Sharma To Everyone:
	yes you can say it is predicting next items in the series
00:08:25 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	thanks!
00:09:33 From Raj Maragoud To Everyone:
	thank you
00:10:44 From Maksim Virskii To Everyone:
	On this lecture slide with compression with DeepAD& Prophet systems it is shown that recommendation algorithms are used for financial data forecasting. Do you know if it is an industry standard and is used or this was a sort of ‚Äúpower demonstration‚Äù and is not explored so far?
00:14:47 From Mary Pastore To Everyone:
	CPI, Sector growth?
00:14:50 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	are we sometimes incorrectly using prediction  and recommendation interchargeably?
00:15:11 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	taking movies recommendation as an example, will the recommendation be also adjusted based on other user's ratings? not necessary the target user.
00:15:26 From Mary Pastore To Everyone:
	Are you aware of data that is publicly available for stock analysis?
00:15:44 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam Sharma To Everyone:
	all the stock prices are available
00:15:53 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam Sharma To Everyone:
	also global indicators are there
00:17:29 From Victor Mensah To Everyone:
	Great..... Got it...
00:17:41 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	Subham I have a question on elective project specifically code I sent it in slack If you and or Nirupam can stay back 2 mins that will be nice in this call at the end
00:17:51 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	so, in applied data science: how do you see recommendations? (I got the predictions)
00:18:45 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	ha! thanks! also a fan here.
00:18:54 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	will do.. thanks.
00:18:56 From Marco Ocana To Everyone:
	I predicted your rating!
00:18:59 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	During the Basque county hand written example the prof took a 1* 9 matrix, divided them into 3 sections  and wrote them in columns ( 3 x 3 matrix). He said that this method was very effective. In this way, aren't we losing the original 'timeline'?
00:20:06 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	I see thanks!
00:21:44 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	i must go now. Thanks very much for your help. Truly useful. I will watch this video again before completing my Capstone and Elective Project.
00:21:55 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	I have a question about the elective project as well
00:23:44 From Andrew Mariano To Everyone:
	Ha...!  I have a question about a project.  I have a very short piece of code that I know 100% is correct... but I get errors with it...!   what do I do...?
00:24:04 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	My project question is - I selected Practical data science project where we are predicting the resource will be converted to paid member or not. So it is a classification problem. When I do the decision tree and get the 3 parameters. My scores are 1 for all 3 in training and testing and even if I train with 1 and test for 99 it is still the same
00:24:47 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	can you tell me some reasons why this will be
00:25:07 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	If this is the case we cant do any more tuning or it is not needed but I am sure there is some issue
00:26:36 From Mary Pastore To Everyone:
	What would you consider the core algorithms that we absolutely need to have complete understanding of  for Machine Learning?
00:27:31 From Rahul Rana To Everyone:
	I realized the elective project problem statement is different from what was mentioned on the google form. Did the form specify capstone project?
00:27:46 From Venkatesh Prasad To Everyone:
	Hi Andrew, I can take a look at your code.
00:28:21 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	For the Deep Learning capstones/elective projects, won't the training take a long time since its image data? do we just use google colab GPUs or is there any other way?
00:28:33 From Mary Pastore To Everyone:
	thank you
00:29:08 From Sashi Rekha Manickam Kasiviswanathan To Everyone:
	Do we have content-based recommendation case study ?
00:29:16 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	Deep learning vs recommendation systems, which one has better job market today?
00:29:34 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	Dropped id and also dropped status (Target variable) from X but still it pops up so I guess that's the issue but not sure how to resolve it because I drop and it pops up again
00:29:48 From Sujatha Papagani To All Panelists:
	You suggest a support request then ?
00:29:57 From [GL Mentor] Niruppam Sharma To Sujatha Papagani and All Panelists:
	yes
00:30:06 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	And we just start with the elective project of our choice for this week? the form feedback is more related to the final capstone?
00:30:16 From Victor C Salas To Everyone:
	GL team, Thanks!
