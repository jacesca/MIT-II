	how do you decide who gets the number of wins? is ist the row person?
22:12:24 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	what if there are ties or 4 to 2 wins
22:13:53 From Jyothi Ponde To Everyone:
	What if somebody is not in any group?
22:15:21 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	thank you
22:15:59 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	Sort of like Great Learning‚Äôs feedback
22:16:11 From Sharmila Veera To Everyone:
	If there is a group of new players coming in how would we fit in?
22:19:30 From Charles Henderson To Everyone:
	What's the paper that describes how that is solved?
22:20:09 From Mary Pastore To Everyone:
	If Multiple people interview one person, and each person is asked to rank based on one criteria, what kind of ranking model would this be?
22:21:15 From Ron Carino To All Panelists:
	i would imagine skill score for a certain user can get better if the ‚Äòwas this review helpful?‚Äô score increases
22:22:15 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Do we usually bring in info from different problem to support the decision making of one problem? In examples 0.1 and 0.9 will be from same problem info or other problem info?
22:23:55 From Steve Trenfield To Everyone:
	How do recommendation systems handle response bias? With something like Yelp for instance, people are more likely to review a place that they really like or really hate without much in between
22:24:18 From Jean-Christophe Pignon To Everyone:
	Are recommendation systems used in (bio)medical field?
22:25:39 From Venkatesh Prasad To Everyone:
	Can we use distance to the closest user, to fill in the blanks?
22:25:47 From Charles Henderson To Everyone:
	Since LLM are designed to predict missing values, what is the connection between LLM filling in missing values (next word) and fill in the missing values for recommendation?
22:26:48 From Mohamed Othman To Everyone:
	is correlated reviews acceptable? as a review is affected by other reviews leading to loops, or positive feedback.
22:27:11 From Rewa Rai To Everyone:
	Can we also recommend experimental methods that which will be the better than other?
22:27:46 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	sorry, LLMs are time... ??
22:27:49 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	time series?
22:31:09 From Charles Henderson To Everyone:
	+ = reward outliers, - = penalize outliers?
22:31:14 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	error drops as N ‚Äî> higher
22:31:15 From Sashi Rekha Manickam Kasiviswanathan To Everyone:
	Std error corrections
22:31:31 From Jean-Christophe Pignon To Everyone:
	to take account average error?
22:31:46 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	big sample size, little fudge factor
22:31:47 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	is it because the missing values ar enot equally spread?
22:35:44 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	so in effect you are using the upper bound (or lower bound) of the  conf interval, using z score of 1. Why 1, why not 1.96?
22:35:53 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	üëèüèΩ
22:36:11 From Yolanda Dolores To Everyone:
	It is like skewing the data,"correcting?"? +1/n
22:36:33 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	In case of coin toss (Again fair coins) it is always 0.5 so will this even apply ?
22:36:58 From Alpha Barry To Everyone:
	How do we evaluate the recommendation system accuracy?
22:37:02 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	thx!
22:40:39 From Nicholas Okot To Everyone:
	Are there application of recommendation system in public policy analysis?
22:43:59 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	independent districting for voting?
22:44:45 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	since the diagonal cells should be 1, can you use the observed to de-noise non-diag cells?
22:45:31 From Sriram Akella To Everyone:
	For clustering the movies, what could be the features that we could use? And will the user prices be one of them?
22:45:34 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	that was an attempt and Nich‚Äôs question
22:45:38 From Bill Hutchison To Everyone:
	So are these clusters not necessarily interpretable by a human?
22:46:11 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	about public policy application
22:46:27 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	So can this be used for mediation to resolve a conflict between union and employer?
22:47:18 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	my sense is you can use these systems for anything but you have to be careful - because the error could be serious. which is probably why causal inference is employed.
22:47:39 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	Its why I buy so much crap I don‚Äôt need
22:47:48 From Anthony Washington To Everyone:
	Good Question Chih-Chung. We are always resolving union grievances and clustering is used for job assignment
22:47:48 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	me too!
22:47:51 From Alexander Prinz To Everyone:
	üòÖ
22:49:51 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	so union has different levels of employees within that may have different demand and the employer have different department/management (for example, if employees asking for collective raise, then finance may have different opinion "likes" on certain offer than what board of investors of the company may like.  so if we both side onto this matrix then we can get a recommended set so solutions that mediator can use to try to bring both side of the group into agreement? Thanks!
22:50:31 From Henry Ngan To Everyone:
	Q.  Some of the popular and commonly known Recommendation Systems are. 1. Yelp, 2. Netflix, 3. Amazon, etc.  I personally do not hear as much in Financial Services, can you kindly share some Recommendation Systems used in Financial Services if any please?   Portfolio Construction Recommendations?  Stock Recommendations?
22:51:21 From Ihor Aleksykov To Everyone:
	Did he do any sorting before drawing ? Because normally it could be just lines (or some noise), right?
22:51:48 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	for sure thank you prof!
22:51:59 From Alexander Prinz To Everyone:
	What was the basis for the clustering in the MovieLens example? Just the ratings or other user/item features?
22:52:33 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	Is this visual representation/ plot available in Python?
22:52:34 From Alexander Prinz To Everyone:
	üëçüèº
22:52:50 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
22:56:44 From Gladys joseph To Everyone:
	principal component analysis
22:57:03 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	Dimension reduction tool right
22:58:05 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	thank you for leaving the writing on the slide!
22:59:36 From James Appenzeller To Everyone:
	sounds like a nash equilibrium problem
22:59:44 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Heat map , pca , Kmeans and observations is what have done in our initial project So all problems  are finally recommendation systems ?
23:00:13 From Srikanth Susarapu To Everyone:
	once we identify the clusters of users , is the intent to recommend to these users a collection of items that they may have rated ? Is there criteria to decide what items to recommend to what user?
23:00:29 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	great thanks!
23:00:51 From James Appenzeller To Everyone:
	yah, the negotiation problem
23:01:22 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Nicely put thank you.
23:02:22 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	While we‚Äôre on break: The voting districts may not be a recommendation system. it could just be a scoring system that shows the fairness of a redistricting map in a state based on party affiliation and address to minimize the difference between the district split from the statewide split in elections.
23:03:50 From Srikanth Susarapu To Everyone:
	assuming that the prediction problem is solved, would a business decide to cultivate the clusters or to cross pollinate clusters by recommending dissimilar items among clusters? Is there a case to be made either way?
23:05:40 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	@Skrikanth: crossover films.  Kids/Comedy to get a bigger audience!
23:06:08 From Tamari Kirtadze To Everyone:
	My screen shows that the professor's audio is muted. Can everyone else hear?
23:06:18 From Srikanth Susarapu To Everyone:
	no , he is muted.
23:06:24 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	no
23:06:27 From Srikanth Susarapu To Everyone:
	i cant hear him if he is speaking
23:06:36 From Shawn Reynolds To Everyone:
	He is very much muted.
23:06:48 From Barbara Caporella To Everyone:
	We're on a break, he is not speaking.
23:06:52 From [GL Mentor] Shubham Sharma To Everyone:
	We are having a 5 min break
23:07:10 From Tamari Kirtadze To Everyone:
	Thank you!
23:07:25 From Chih-Chung Wuo To Everyone:
	Great thank you Anthony Washington for confirming real situations (I am in Vancouver by the way and ILWU has been on strike for a week now hence comes to my mind quickly)
23:09:55 From Anthony Washington To Everyone:
	We are always in contract negotiates.   I totally understand.  In past, clustering was definitely used in this way.  Kudos to you and the union. Good luck with the strike! Solidarity.
23:10:24 From Alpha Barry To Everyone:
	Prof, how do you do to stop the time? Your clock is always on 9:41 AM Tue Jan 9 :)
23:11:15 From Charles Henderson To Everyone:
	Recommendation not in the temporal domain
23:11:33 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	did you just choose the first 3? or, is there a sub set pre-selected?
23:11:49 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
	he selected user to user
23:15:31 From Edwin Obando Hernandez To Everyone:
	What is the difference respect to Euclidean distance?.
23:15:32 From Samer El Boustany To Everyone:
	what should be the minimum of known ratings for both users? if one user saw only one movie the information for the clustering will not be very accurate no?
23:16:58 From Srikanth Susarapu To Everyone:
	-1 .. they are polar opposites
23:17:02 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	zero match. they should not eat together
23:18:58 From Anthony Washington To Everyone:
	Not a question!
23:19:04 From Sriram Akella To Everyone:
	So cosine similartty will always be between 1 and 0
23:19:05 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	2 and 3 were always dissimilar as for none of the items they had common rating..
23:19:08 From Sriram Akella To Everyone:
	And it cannot be -1?
23:19:23 From Anthony Washington To Everyone:
	I was just giving support to another member of the cohort.
23:19:26 From Steve Trenfield To Everyone:
	I don‚Äôt know the answer either, but when I connect my iPad to my computer and screen share, it also goes to 9:41am on Tuesday, January 9th
23:19:29 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	in 1 and 2 we have 3 entries only where as 2 and 3 has 4 entries we collected So is there a factor we can assign to this in any method ?
23:19:29 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	I saw the same Jan 9 time in Muzher Dahleh screen too, so it is the MIT portal thing
23:19:36 From Bill Hutchison To Everyone:
	What happens if all the matches are 0-0?
23:20:01 From Angel Rafael Ortega Ramirez To Everyone:
	so... is it possible to get the probability of similarity? or we are just calculating a similarity score?
23:20:29 From Marja Crawford To All Panelists:
	my name is pronounced Mar+"ya"
23:20:51 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	I‚Äôm sorry, do you mind explaining a bit further the intuition behind the smaller purple matrix on the right ?
23:21:20 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	So for the sparse matrix, the ‚Äú?‚Äù Is replaced by averaging other similarities and inferring from where there is overlapping data for the missing data?
23:21:25 From Edwin Obando Hernandez To Everyone:
	Great. Thanks!
23:22:10 From Samer El Boustany To Everyone:
	ok thanks
23:23:02 From kagiso monkge To Everyone:
	Is the rating like and not like
23:23:13 From Venkatesh Prasad To Everyone:
	Can we use similarities between restaurants to compare ratings?
23:23:18 From kagiso monkge To Everyone:
	suppose rating was 0-5
23:23:29 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	i think i missed something - i thought you mentioned that 2 vectors that are 180 degress apart lead to sim=-1?
23:23:38 From Vahid Monfared To Everyone:
	if the similarity result is -1, what would be the unknowns?
23:24:39 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	Are there other types of similarity functions we can use?
23:24:57 From Ron Carino To Everyone:
	per reddit: It‚Äôs a reference to date and time that the iPhone was revealed to the public (January 9th 2007 9:41). It‚Äôs a iOS/iPadOS ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. If you see the Apple marketing, usually the products are showing that same date and time.
23:27:59 From Pam Marcus To Everyone:
	i must leave early today. thanks to all for another great class.
23:29:00 From Rewa Rai To Everyone:
	May be I missed. What's singular value mean here?
23:29:21 From Samer El Boustany To Everyone:
	eighen values and vectors?
23:31:09 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Can you explain what are S and sigma again?
23:33:12 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Thanks got it..
23:33:37 From Daniel Ayer To Everyone:
	PCA was to identify features that most affected vector properties and eliminate low effect features.
	Here we seem to be truncating to achieve the same dimensional reduction.  Are we saying that some threshold of data energy is sufficient as in the PPCA evaluation for feature effect?
	I'm sorry if that's not so clear.
	this seems similar too but distinct from PCA.
23:33:40 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	S is the similarity matrix. sigmas are components of S?
23:33:58 From Maliha Ahmad To Everyone:
	thank you!
23:34:07 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	What do we gain by applying PCA in this context, and not jumping straight into K-Means?
23:34:09 From Rewa Rai To Everyone:
	Thx!
23:35:09 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	0.9 ..Alpha Level of significance ?
23:35:13 From Andrew Mariano To Everyone:
	How is it that d=2...?
23:35:37 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	This is like the elbow method?
23:35:43 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	Is that what d represents ?
23:36:15 From Jeanelle Frontin To Everyone:
	üëçüèΩ
23:36:30 From Alpha Barry To Everyone:
	That elbow hardly works
23:36:43 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	I would say is in between eye-balling, plotting, and K clustering??
23:37:06 From ivan salido To All Panelists:
	Silhouette maybe?
23:37:21 From Arif-ur-Rahman Joarder To All Panelists:
	Why not DBSCAN?
23:37:37 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Philosophy,Art and science very good choice of words Proff :-)
23:37:42 From Maksim Virskii To All Panelists:
	uij in PCA - are vectors of [0‚Ä¶0.1.0.00] type?
23:42:07 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	and you find them by using the previous tool of Similarities, correct?
23:43:11 From James Appenzeller To Everyone:
	very impressive!
23:44:09 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	By proxy
23:44:56 From Will Kerner To Everyone:
	Inherent pitfalls I‚Äôm sure
23:46:00 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	Could you explain user-user or item-item collaborative filtering?
23:46:58 From Theodoros Alexandropoulos To Everyone:
	Given the fact that that 99% of FB users are reachable within 6 hops (as stated in Week 2 by Prof Uhler) I believe this friend graph would actually correspond to the worst case scenario...
23:47:23 From Joab Odera To Everyone:
	Wouldn't this method lead to increasing certain biases?

23:49:05 From Elizabeth Gozzer To Everyone:
	Application: other than for movies or purchases or similar products.. could you use this to identify the best combination of interventions for a international development program?
23:49:19 From David Sachs To Everyone:
	I feel like we really blew through the last bit (with the matrix before pca)
23:51:35 From leo-shuxiong wu To Everyone:
	Even they gave the same rating. They may have different feelings. Maybe someone rate 2 is same with others rating 4 ,because they have different understand of rate numbers.  How can we see this kind of similarity?

23:57:10 From Sujatha Papagani To Everyone:
	Proff - Silly or smart may be - Can you give us a 80/20 rule for Data science - Meaning if we cover this 20% of the course you can get 80% of the information needed to become a good / comfortable data scientist
23:57:27 From Aseem Gupta To Everyone:
	So you fix 0.9 to calculate r?
23:58:12 From Cris Arias To Everyone:
	In collaborative filtering, do we necessarily need to apply PCA or can we just go from the similarity matrix to K-means?
23:58:19 From Changsong Liu To Everyone:
	but 0 originally means "dislike", in SVT we replace * with 0, is this OK
23:59:43 From Anuradha Rajkumar To Everyone:
	can you explain step 3 again please?
00:01:01 From Marja Crawford To Everyone:
